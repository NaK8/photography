But it allows to obtain the correct flash-exposed shots with a lack of light in a sequential shooting - especially indoors. And also greatly gains at light enough, but incorrect, creates sharp  and unsightly shadows - for example, at bright summer day, or against backlight.`,

And it seems the camera was set up as it should, and interesting background is selected, but the result is not what was expected. And sometimes, hastily we get brilliantly executed shots. Many people complain of being not photogenic, but it has no sense.`,
